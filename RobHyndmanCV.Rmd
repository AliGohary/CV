# Current memberships

  * Elected Member, International Statistical Institute
  * Member, International Institute of Forecasters
  * Member, International Association for Statistical Computing
  * Member, Statistical Society of Australia
  * Member, International Society for Business and Industrial Statistics

# Research

  * Since 1991 I have authored `r length(pubs)` papers, chapters or books on statistical topics. A list of these appears on pages \pageref{papersstart}--\pageref{papersend}.
  * My current research involves the analysis of large collections of time series, and includes visualization, forecasting, reconciliation and modelling. Applications include electricity demand and smart-meter data, security sensors, manufacturing data and retail sales.
  * I currently supervise six PhD students and two post-doctoral research fellows. I have previously supervised another 22 PhD students and 3 Masters students.
  * I publish the [*Hyndsight*](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight) blog on research issues which receives an average of about 2000 pageviews per day.
  * I have produced `r length(packages)` R packages as a result of my research. These are listed on pages \pageref{packagestart}--\pageref{packageend}.
